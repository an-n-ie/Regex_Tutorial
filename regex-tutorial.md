# Regex Tuorial: Matching an Email

A tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.

## Summary

A regex is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms or for input validation. To put it simply, regex is an input validator when a specific format is required from the user. We will be breaking down the components of a regex in matching an email. 

The following is an example: `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
